# 📡 HMM Regime Terminal

A professional **regime-based algorithmic trading system** that uses a **7-state Gaussian Mixture Model Hidden Markov Model (GMM-HMM)** to detect market states and layers technical confirmation strategies with strict risk management on top.

Works with any ticker recognised by Yahoo Finance — stocks, ETFs, crypto, futures, and indices.

🚀 **Streamlit App** [gmm-hmm-trading-and-backtest.streamlit.app](https://gmm-hmm-trading-and-backtest.streamlit.app/)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hmm-trading.git
cd hmm-trading

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Launch the dashboard
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

Opens at `http://localhost:8501`. On first load it downloads ~365 days of daily OHLCV data and fits the GMM-HMM (~10–30 seconds). Subsequent loads use a 5-minute cache.

## ✨ Features

### 📡 Backtester Page
- **Detected Regime** — Bull Run / Bear/Crash / Neutral/Transition with sub-state name (e.g. "State 6 · Steady Uptrend")
- **Live Quote** — real-time price via `yf.fast_info` (60-second refresh) with PST timestamp
- **Company Profile** — sector, industry, market cap, employee count, business summary
- **TradingView-style Price Chart** — candlestick with HMM regime background bands, SMA-50, volume histogram, buy/sell markers (sell shows P&L %), and a **10-day kernel regression forecast** with ±1σ confidence band
- **Technical Confirmation Scorecard** — 10 configurable checks (momentum, ATR, volume, ADX, MACD, Stochastic, SMAs, RSI)
- **Equity Curve** — strategy vs. Buy & Hold with Sharpe Ratio comparison
- **Performance Metrics** — Total Return, Alpha, Max Drawdown, Win Rate, B&H Sharpe delta
- **Trade Log** — full table with CSV export
- **Parameter Optimizer** — grid-searches `bear_confirm_days`, `min_confirms`, `min_hold_days` to maximise return
- **Watchlist** — saved tickers with dropdown, auto-add on type, persistent across sessions

### 🔍 Stock Screener Page
- Scans **S&P 500**, **Nasdaq 100**, or **Russell 2000** for Bull Run entries in parallel
- Ranks results by composite entry-quality score (HMM Bull probability + confirmations + freshness)
- Configurable min confirmations, max bars in bull run, thread count

## 🧠 How It Works

### GMM-HMM Engine
A **7-state GMMHMM** (`hmmlearn`) is fit on 4 engineered daily features:

| Feature | Formula | Captures |
|---|---|---|
| `returns` | log(Closeₜ / Closeₜ₋₁) | Daily directional momentum |
| `range` | (High − Low) / Close | Intraday volatility |
| `vol_change` | StdDev(Volume,20) / Mean(Volume,20) | Abnormal volume |
| `trend_return` | log(Closeₜ / Closeₜ₋₂₀) | 20-day trend |

States are auto-labelled by mean return:
- **Top 3** → 🟢 Bull Run (sub-states 5–7)
- **Bottom 2** → 🔴 Bear/Crash (sub-states 1–2)
- **Middle 2** → 🟡 Neutral/Transition (sub-states 3–4)

### Strategy Logic
- **Entry** — triggers on Bull Run transition when ≥ N confirmations are met
- **Exit** — triggers after `bear_confirm_days` consecutive Bear bars
- **Regime-Only Mode** — bypass confirmations entirely; trade on regime transitions alone

### 10-Day Kernel Regression Forecast
For today's feature vector (`vol_surge`, `atr_ratio`, `pct_from_high`, `momentum_5d`, `regime_num`), a Gaussian kernel finds the weighted distribution of similar historical 10-day forward paths — yielding an expected price path and ±1σ confidence band displayed as dashed lines on the chart.

## ⚙️ Configuration

All controls are in the sidebar:

| Control | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Ticker Symbol | BTC-USD | Any ticker recognised by Yahoo Finance (see examples below) |
| Look-back Period | 365 days | Historical data window for HMM training |
| Leverage | 1× | 1×, 2×, or 4× position sizing |
| Bear Confirm Days | 5 | Consecutive Bear bars required to exit |
| Min Hold Days | 7 | Minimum hold before trailing stop fires |
| Trailing Stop | Off | 2% trailing stop-loss |
| Regime-Only Mode | Off | Trade on regime transitions only |
| Min Confirmations | 3/10 | Minimum technical checks for entry |

### 🔖 Ticker Examples

Ticker symbols must be recognised by Yahoo Finance. The default watchlist includes:

| Category | Tickers |
|---|---|
| **Stocks** | AG, AMD, AMZN, AVGO, BWXT, CIEN, COHR, GEV, GLW, GOOG, INTC, LITE, MU, NVDA, OKLO, PLTR, SMR, SNDK, VRT, VRTX, WDC |
| **Crypto** | BTC-USD, ETH-USD, SOL-USD |
| **Futures** | CL=F (Crude Oil), ES=F (S&P 500 Futures), GC=F (Gold), HG=F (Copper), SI=F (Silver) |
| **ETFs** | EWY, GDX, GLD, IWM, QQQ, SLV, SPY, TLT, USO |

Any other valid Yahoo Finance symbol can be entered manually in the Ticker Symbol field.
